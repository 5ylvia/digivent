## Developing
### Vue

>1. All components file name should be always PascalCase.
>2. All Folders are always kebab-case.
>3. Each component should be in its own folder.
>4. Try to create both speaker and user side in one component.
>If it is not available, make seperately and put them in the same folder.
>5. Child components that are tightly coupled with their parent should include the parent component name as a prefix.
